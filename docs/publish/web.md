A common way to publish your book content is to create an HTML version of your book (also called a _static website_) and host it on the web somewhere.
There are a few ways to do this, and this section covers the methods available to you.

When publishing to online locations, it may be useful to activate error logging on the terminal in MyST-NB.
This allows you to see tracebacks that happen as a result of executing notebooks as part of your build process.
To do so, see [](execute:tracebacks).
