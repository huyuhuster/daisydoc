# Overview of Daisy project

The Daisy project provides tools to support the processing of data from Advanced synchrotron radiation light source, such as High Energy Photon Sourceï¼ŒHEPS. This data can be gathered from experiments or as the result of simulation. The project provides:

  - a Python library, daisy, providing custom high-performance algorithms and data structures for processing compatible data

  - a general-purpose graphical user interface, DaisyWorkench, for visualisation of raw or processed data including

       - matplotlib-based plotting

       - script editor allowing immediate script execution

       - a slice viewer for slicing through higher-dimensional data

       - custom graphical user interfaces for a variety of scientific techniques to reduce the burden on users understanding how to process their data

The tools are:

   - open source

   - 64-bit, cross platform: Linux, Windows

   - built using many other open source projects.
