DAISY (Data Analysis Integrated Software System) is a software framework developed using object-oriented technology and programming languages such as C++ and Python. It was originally designed for advanced photon source scientific data processing. During its initial design, it was inspired by some of the world's leading data processing software projects, including DAWN, a data analysis software developed for the Diamond Light Source in the UK; Mantid, a data analysis software framework developed for the ISIS neutron and muon source in the UK; EDNA, an online data processing software framework developed for European Synchrotron Radiation Facility; and Gaudi, a data processing software framework for high energy physics.

The aim of DAISY was to create a versatile and highly extensible basic software architecture. It integrates various methodological algorithms and tools, abstracting away the complexity of the computational architecture and the diversity of computing resources. This framework provides a uniform and simple interface for higher-level application software and users, with additional development of generic components, including desktop tools for data visualisation and analysis, aimed at fostering a rich and thriving software ecosystem.
